I finally decided to start my developer oriented blog using Jekyll to create a static blog and AWS S3 to host it.
As a developer interested in Cloud, I already had an AWS account. If you don't you can sign use other static file hosts
like Netlify, etc. Jekyll is a static site generator which is developer friendly and does not need much configuring.
I find a lot of decisions/configuring before I get to the actual work itself tends to turn me off.
Hence, quickly accomplishing the basics is what I am striving for here.

Brief tutorial to create and host your own blog using Jekyll and AWS S3

1. Install Jekyll by following the official tutorial from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/
2. Create and configure a new S3 bucket for static website hosting
3. Push your site from your computer to S3
